			<t>This document describes the Namespace IDentifier (NID) 'metaverse-standards-org' for Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by Metaverse Standards Forum. The forum specifies and manages resources that utilize this URN identification model. Example resources include ressources, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) Schemas, classification schemes, XML Document Type Definitions (DTDs), namespaces, style sheets, and other types of resources produced or managed by the Metaverse Standards Forum.</t>

			<name>Introduction</name>
			<t>The Metaverse Standards Forum is a non-profit, member-funded consortium of standards-related organizations, companies, and institutions that are cooperating to foster interoperability for an open and inclusive metaverse. Originally founded in June 2022, the Forum was incorporated in April 2023 to accelerate its mission to enable and promote broad cooperation and coordination over metaverse-related standards activities. The Forum does not itself create standards but instead generates domain and technical reports, use case and requirements recommendations, pilots, testbeds and plugfests, open source tooling, best practices and guidelines, and other data, insights, and visibility to enable standards organizations to accelerate the development and evolution of standards that will be essential to building the metaverse. As part of these efforts, there is a need to specify identifiers in a managed namespace that are unique and persistent.  To ensure that this namespace's uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a specific Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC8141] Namespace Identifier (NID) for use by Metaverse Standards Forum is specified in this document, in full conformance with the NID registration process specified in [RFC8141].</t>
			<t>This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.</t>

				</dd>
				<dt>Declaration of syntactic structure:</dt>
				<dd>
					<t>The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the Metaverse Standards NID will have the following structure:</t>
					<t>urn:ieee:{MSFresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}</t>
					<t>where "MSFresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN syntax requirements [RFC 2141] and defines a specific class of resource type. Each resource type has a specific labeling scheme that is covered by "ResourceSpecificString", which also conforms to the naming requirements [RFC2141].</t>
					<t>The Metaverse Standards Forum maintains a registration procedure within the Standards Register Domain Group (SRDG) that will manage the assignment of "MSFresource" and the specific registration values assigned foreach resource class.</t>
				</dd>
				<dt>Relevant ancillary documentation:</dt>
				<dd>none</dd>
				<dt>Identifier uniqueness considerations:</dt>
				<dd>
					<t>The SRDG of the MSF manages resources using the "metaverse-standards-org" NID and will be the authority for managing the resources and subsequent strings associated.  In the associated procedures, SRDG will ensure the uniqueness of the strings themselves or shall permit secondary responsibility for the management of well-defined sub-trees.</t> 
					<t>The MSF may permit the use of experimental type values that will not be registered.  As a consequence, multiple users may end up using the same value for separate uses.  As experimental usage is only intended for testing purposes, this should not be a real issue.</t> 
				</dd>
				<dt>Identifier persistence considerations:</dt>
				<dd>
					<t>The MSF provides clear documentation on a number of the registered uses of the "metaverse-standards-org" NID.  Additional uses developed by the MSF membership in the future will be first approved by the SRDG and then by the entire MSF voting membership. This is the normal process for all MSF permanent resources for use by the community.</t>
					<t>The SRDG maintains a permanent registry of approved uses.  This resource is structured such that each "MSFresource" has a separate description and registration table.</t>
					<t>The registration tables and information are published and maintained by the SRDG on the MSF web site.</t>
				</dd>
				<dt>Process of identifier assignment:</dt>
				<dd>
					<t>The SRDG uses the approved MSF policies and procedures for discussion, approval, and registration of each type of resource maintained.</t>
				</dd>
				<dt>Process for identifier resolution:</dt>
					<dd>The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.</dd>
				<dt>Rules for lexical equivalence:</dt>
					<dd>No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of [RFC2141] apply.</dd>
				<dt>Conformance with URN syntax:</dt>
					<dd>No special considerations.</dd>
				<dt>Validation mechanism:</dt>
					<dd>None specified. URN assignment will be handled by procedures implemented in support of Metaverse Standards Forum activities.</dd>
				<dt>Scope:</dt>
					<dd>Global</dd>

			<name>Example</name>
			<t>The following example represents a hypothetical URN that could be assigned by Metaverse Standards Forum:</t>
			<t>urn:metaverse-standards-org:use-case:ar-white-board:2023</t>
			<t>This example defines the URN to be used for a usecase defined in the Metaverse Standards Forum. An associated description of the use case is published.</t>

		<section>
			<name>Namespace Considerations</name>
			<t>Metaverse Standards Forum develops ressources that may require the use of data models.  URN Namespaces are key constructs to manage the definitions of those data models reliably with persistence and uniqueness.</t>
			<t>The use of URNs should also help specification authors to maintain different versions of URNs and dependencies between URNs across different versions of Metaverse Standards Forum ressources if they so wish.</t>
		</section>
		<section>
			<name>Community Considerations</name>
			<t>Participants involved in the development and usage of Metaverse Standards Forum ressources and Metaverse industry deployments will benefit from the publication of this namespace by providing consistent and reliable names for the XML namespaces, schema locations, and similar identifiers of physical data models published within Metaverse Standards Forum ressources</t>

		<section anchor="IANA">
			<!-- All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section. See RFC 8126 for a guide.-->
			<name>IANA Considerations</name>
			<t>This document adds a new entry ("metaverse-standards-org") in the urn-namespaces registry.  This is the defining document.  The entry can be found in the "Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces" registry available from the IANA site (http://www.iana.org) and any associated mirrors.</t>
		</section>
		<section anchor="Security">
			<!-- All drafts are required to have a security considerations section. See RFC 3552 for a guide. -->
			<name>Security Considerations</name>
			<t>There are no additional security considerations other than those normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general, which are described in [RFC1737], [RFC2141], and [RFC8141].</t>
